Implementation of Surface Free Design proposed in
# A Surface-Free Design for Phase~I Dual-Agent Combination Trials
by
# P. Mozgunov, M. Gasparini & T. Jaki (2020)

The repository includes the following files:


# 1. Function-To-Compute-Prior-Means.R
This code provides the mean prior point estimates for the connections \theta and \tau given the toxicity probabilities of each agent given as a monotherapy.

# 2. Surface-Free-Design-3-by-3.R
This code implements the Surface Free Design in the case of dual-agent combination trial with 3 doses of each agent as considered in Section 3 of the paper. 
The code also provides the allocation probabilities in the illustrative trial (Figure 3)

# 3. Surface-Free-Design-4-by-4.R
This code implements the Surface Free Design in the case of dual-agent combination trial with 4 doses of each agent as considered in Section 4 of the paper and in Supplementary Materials. The code also allows for the implementation of the ranodmisation rule based on the posterior point estimates.
